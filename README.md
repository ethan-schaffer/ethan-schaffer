### Hi, I'm Ethan!

🐢 I'm a Computer Science Major at the University of Maryland, College Park.

💡 I'm most interested in back end development, and in using data to solve tough problems. 

🐍 My favorite programming languages are Python and Scala. I'm also experienced in Java.

🔎 You can find me on LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethan-schaffer/).
