### Hi, I'm Ethan!

🐢 I'm a Computer Science Major at the University of Maryland, College Park.

💡 I'm most interested in back end development, and in using data to solve tough problems. 

🌐 My personal website is [ethan.schaffer.com](http://ethan.schaffer.com/)

🐍 My favorite programming languages are Python and Scala. I'm also experienced in Java.

🔎 You can find me on LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethan-schaffer/).

⬇️ You can check out a few projects that I've worked on, they're pinned below. One of my most recent is a [website](https://ethan-schaffer.github.io/UMD-Online-Course-Info/) that scrapes and gathers information from the University of Maryland's [schedule of classes](https://app.testudo.umd.edu/soc/). I also recently made a PyGame simulator inspired by LivingRPS, a TikTok account I liked.
